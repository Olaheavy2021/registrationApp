You don\u2019t have to wait for someone to die or retire to move up, like in a mega-corp. You\u2019ll grow with us!\n\nVidalytics\u2019 Values\n\n(Yes, We\u2019re Actually Serious About These)   \n\n1 \u2013 Meritocracy \u2013 we\u2019re building a Meritocracy, where the best ideas win \u2014 not based on who has the bigger title. The following values underpin this. You should embody these traits.\n\n2 \u2013 Direct & honest communication (transparency) \u2013 to be successful we have to face the truth and be honest. And that starts with each other. That means we give direct feedback. We want it in exchange. So feel free to argue your points, just be ready to get onboard with decisions once they are made.\n\n3 \u2013 Ownership & Accountability \u2013 the best people are the ones who OWN their position, tasks and even things that go beyond their \u2018day to day responsibilities\u2019. They never say, \u201cthat\u2019s not my job.\u201d Instead, they proactively spot problems and always try to think like the owner of the business.\n\n4 \u2013 Intelligence and smarts \u2013 we prize smart people. Who doesn\u2019t? But it\u2019s not just book smarts but \u201cbusiness smarts\u201d where you\u2019re able to solve problems. Think for yourself. And don\u2019t be intimidated by any problem, no matter how complex. (Aka growth mindset).\n\n5 \u2013 Self-aware (personal growth) \u2013 we want people who can look at themselves objectively, admit their mistakes and be open to growth. When you bring this attitude to your profession, it becomes a place of personal development and self-actualization.\n\n6 \u2013 Integrity \u2013 trust is the glue that holds us together. We need to be able to trust you whether it is regarding the quality of your hours, the deadlines you set for yourself or anything else.\n\n7- Urgency \u2013 we\u2019re a startup and you need to be able to meet deadlines. We need someone who pushes themselves when they need to and hits deadlines. And also knows how to prioritize the important things.\n\n8 \u2013 Hard working \u2013 we\u2019re trying to get shit done on a budget. If you\u2019re looking for an easy job, go elsewhere. Instead, this job will constantly have challenges and opportunities to learn and grow professionally. But we try to have fun while we\u2019re doing it and consider each other friends.\n\n9 \u2013 Data \u2013 whenever possible, we want to make decisions based on data, not emotions or opinions.\n\n10 \u2013 No assholes \u2013 Doesn\u2019t matter how good someone is at their job, if they are going to make life suck for other people on the team, then they aren\u2019t welcomed at Vidalytics.\n\nCheers,\n\n    \n\nErika Lehmann\n\nCo-Founder / Head of Product @ Vidalytics",
